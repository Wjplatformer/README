## What is this?
README.template is a public template, for almost all the markdown you would need. These include documentation, writing posts on [Forem](https://github.com/forem), making full fledged websites, and more! As of right now, most templates created by me, the owner, is work in progress. Check in in a few weeks, and you may see a new one popping up!

## Hey, I wanna make a template!
Well, not to worry, pull requests are welcome! Create your own markdown standard, maybe even put your profile README, anything goes!
